On this site, you will be able to find some of my projects completed during my time at McMaster University.\nCurrently, I am a Personal Banking Associate at TD Canada Trust, where I provide professional financial guidance to clients on personal banking products, investments and services. I am very passionate about data science in general, and the use of R in the context of the use of health data for decision-making. I enjoy using (and keep learning) tidyverse to import data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and potentially model it.\n\n\n\n",
