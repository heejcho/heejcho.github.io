Even though COVID-19 vaccination started last December in Canada, inoculation in Ontario has been slow, uneven and uncertain, which led to the provincial government to reimplement a variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as school closures and stay-at-home orders, to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and ensure the number of severe COVID-19 cases did not exceed the capacity of the health system. Using public available data, this project aims to explore the COVID-19 situation in Canada, emphasizing our analysis to Ontario (largest province in terms of population). Our analysis will be constraint from November 1st, 2020 to April 13th,2021\nMain questions\nHow does Canada (Ontario) compare to other countries (provinces) in terms of new COVID-19 infections and deaths? We compared: Canada vs USA and Mexico (North America), and Ontario vs rest of provinces.\nHow did vaccination of Ontario long-term care (LTC) residents impact on mortality? We compared COVID-19 deaths between LTC and non-LTC residents.\nFor Question 1, we used the John Hopkins repository,[1] which tracks COVID-19 reported cases and deaths in real time. Question 2 used the “COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports” (see here), which reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation and others. Finally, Question 3 was answered by using data from the provincial government (see here), containing status of COVID-19 cases in Ontario, such as number of deaths for LTC and non-LTC residents.\nData Wrangling Plan\nQuestion 1\nIteration 1\nPhase 1\nRead the csv files into R.\nWe have two csv’s corresponding to infections and deaths per day.\n\nDetermine if the data is Tidy and if not fix it.\nJoin infections and deaths into a single tibble.\nFilter by countries (provinces) previously chosen in Section Main Questions\nPhase 2\n\n\nconfirmed_raw <- read_csv(paste0(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/\", #read csv\n\"CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/\",\n\"time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv\"), col_types = cols())\ndeaths_raw <- read_csv(paste0(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/\",\n\"CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/\",\n\"time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv\"), col_types = cols())\nconfirmed_raw %>% select(1:6) %>% glimpse() \n\n\nRows: 280\nColumns: 6\n$ `Province/State` <chr> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, \"Australian…\n$ `Country/Region` <chr> \"Afghanistan\", \"Albania\", \"Algeria\", \"Andor…\n$ Lat              <dbl> 33.93911, 41.15330, 28.03390, 42.50630, -11…\n$ Long             <dbl> 67.70995, 20.16830, 1.65960, 1.52180, 17.87…\n$ `1/22/20`        <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ `1/23/20`        <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n\n# death_raw %>% glimpse() same as confirmed\n\n\n\nThe data is not in Tidy format.

In order to take population1 into account in our comparison, we calculated infections (deaths) per million and added a 7-day rolling average (zoo library) to smooth out short-term fluctuations. Deaths time-series plot can be found in the ** Appendix**. scales library was used to format some axis labels.\n\n\npop <- read_csv(\"utils/tidy_pop.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\ntheme <- theme_minimal() + theme(plot.title = element_text(size=9), \n                                 plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size=7,hjust = .5), \n        axis.title.y = element_text(size=7,hjust = .5),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,size = 5),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(angle=90,size = 5),\n        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 4))\n\n\n\n\n\ntib_covid19_country %>% filter(\"2021-04-13\" >= date & date >= \"2020-11-01\") %>% \n  left_join(pop,by=c(\"country\"=\"iso3c\")) %>% group_by(country) %>%\n  mutate(new_confirmed_07da = zoo::rollmean(new_confirmed, k = 7,fill = NA)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% mutate(new_confirmed = 1e6*new_confirmed/population,\n                    new_confirmed_07da = 1e6*new_confirmed_07da/population) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=date,y=new_confirmed)) +  geom_col(alpha=.4, linetype=0) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=new_confirmed_07da),color=\"red\",size = .7) +\n  facet_wrap(~country,scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(title = \"Figure 1:Canada, Mexico and USA new COVID-19 cases per million\", \n                subtitle = paste0(\"7-day rolling average between \", \n                                  \"2020-11-01\" ,\" and \", \"2021-04-13\"),\n                y = \"New Cases\",\n                x = \"Date\") + theme + \n  scale_x_date(date_labels=\"%Y-%m-%d\",date_breaks = \"1 month\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(label = scales::comma)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows new COVID-19 cases per million in the sequence of Canada, Mexico, and USA. As shown, Canada had the highest level of new cases, while Mexico recorded the lowest. 7-day rolling average rates in recent days looks similar between USA and Canada, which is consistent with different news report.[2] To compare provinces, we used the raw numbers for new infections (deaths) because our purpose is to check trends. We used the library geofacet to accommodate the provinces according to their location. Figure 2 displays new COVID-19 cases in Canada across all territories and provinces. The results of each facet shows that the trends have increased in recent days for Ontario, Alberta and Saskatchewan. As observed, Ontario has reached the second wave peak in the most recent days.\n\n\ntib_covid19_province %>% filter(\"2021-04-13\" >= date & date >= \"2020-11-01\") %>% \n  group_by(province) %>%\n  mutate(new_confirmed_07da = zoo::rollmean(new_confirmed, k = 7,fill = NA)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=date,y=new_confirmed)) +\n  geofacet::facet_geo(~ province,\n            grid=\"ca_prov_grid1\",\n            scales= \"free\") +\n  geom_col(alpha = .4, linetype = 0) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = new_confirmed_07da),color=\"red\",size = .7) +\n  labs(title = \"Figure 2: Canada new COVID-19 cases\", \n                subtitle = paste0(\"7-day rolling average between \", \n                                  \"2020-11-01\" ,\" and \", \"2021-04-13\"),\n                y = \"New Cases\",\n                x = \"Date\")  + \n  theme + scale_x_date(date_labels=\"%Y-%m-%d\",date_breaks = \"2 month\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks= scales::pretty_breaks(),label = scales::comma)\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\ntib_covid19_ont %>% filter(\"2021-04-13\" >= date & date >= \"2020-11-01\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(fill=category,y=new_deaths,x=date)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"stack\",stat=\"identity\",linetype=0, alpha = .6) +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels=\"%Y-%m-%d\",date_breaks = \"1 month\") +\n  labs(title = \"Figure 3: Daily deaths by COVID-19 in Ontario\", \n       subtitle = paste0(\"Between \", \"2020-11-01\",  \" and \", \"2021-04-13\"),\n       y = \"New Deaths\",\n       x = \"Date\") + theme +\n  scale_fill_discrete(name= \"\",\n                      labels= c(\"Non-LTC\",\n                                \"LTC\")) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept=as.numeric(as.Date(\"2021-02-23\")), linetype=2)+\n   geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-03-07\"), label=\"Feb 23rd\", y=100))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows COVID-19 daily deaths between LTC residents versus overall population. The results indicate that the rate of daily deaths in LTC residents have reduced significantly since February 23rd. This date was selected because 92% percent of these residents had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.[3]\nDiscussion/Conclusion\nIn this project, the changes in COVID-19 cases between the dates of November 1, 2020 to April 13, 2021 were measured both globally, and nationally. Three main Countries including Canada, Mexico, and USA were used to take global measurement of new COVID-19 cases on a seven-day rolling average. Comparing the results of each Country’s graph, it was observed that in the period of late March 2021, Canada had the highest level of new COVID-19 cases out of all three Countries, Mexico being the lowest. The potential reason for these varying results during this period could be due to restricted testing. Compared to Canada and USA, Mexico lacks the facility and resources to provide COVID-19 tests for the major population. Along with this, the high spikes shown in the graph may indicate limitations, as data anomalies may exist. This anomalies should be corrected in the Data wrangling plan.\nAppendix\n\n\ntib_covid19_country  %>% filter(\"2021-04-13\" >= date & date >= \"2020-11-01\") %>% \n  left_join(pop,by=c(\"country\"=\"iso3c\")) %>% group_by(country) %>%\n  mutate(new_death_07da = zoo::rollmean(new_deaths, k = 7,fill = NA)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% mutate(new_deaths = 1e6*new_deaths/population,\n                    new_death_07da = 1e6*new_death_07da/population) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=date,y=new_deaths)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y=new_death_07da),color=\"red\",size = .7) +\n  geom_col(alpha=.4, linetype=0) + \n  facet_wrap(~country,scales = \"free\") + \n  labs(title = \"Canada, Mexico and USA new COVID-19 deaths per million\", \n                subtitle = paste0(\"7-day rolling average between \", \n                                  \"2020-11-01\" ,\" and \", \"2021-04-13\"),\n                y = \"New Deaths\",\n                x = \"Date\") + theme + scale_x_date(date_labels=\"%Y-%m-%d\",\n                                                   date_breaks = \"1 month\")+ \n  scale_y_continuous(label = scales::comma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntib_covid19_province %>% filter(\"2021-04-13\" >= date & date >= \"2020-11-01\") %>% \n  group_by(province) %>%\n  mutate(new_deaths_07da = zoo::rollmean(new_deaths, k = 7,fill = NA)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=date,y=new_deaths)) +\n  geofacet::facet_geo(~ province,\n            grid=\"ca_prov_grid1\",\n            scales= \"free\") +\n  geom_col(alpha = .4, linetype = 0) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = new_deaths_07da),color=\"red\",size = .7) +\n  labs(title = \"Canada new COVID-19 deaths\", \n                subtitle = paste0(\"7-day rolling average between \", \n                                  \"2020-11-01\" ,\" and \", \"2021-04-13\"),\n                y = \"New Deaths\",\n                x = \"Date\")  + \n  theme + scale_x_date(date_labels=\"%Y-%m-%d\",date_breaks = \"2 month\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks= scales::pretty_breaks(),label = scales::comma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

We operate under this title because we are a group of McMaster (Mac) students who wanted to provide a positive influence for people to take control of their eating habits to prevent the manifestation of various mental illnesses. The philosophy behind this project is to promote healthy eating that supports brain health. We accomplished this by creating mild-paleo diet oriented recipes for meals with ingredients that are proven to improve brain health. Each recipe has a goal of enhancing one or more areas of brain health. For example, omega-3 fatty acids (DHA, EPA) that are found in organic or wild fish reduce the risk of depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease among other things.\nOur target audience is wide-ranging, and we distributed the project over many mediums. It is intended for audiences of all ages, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This criteria was met by preparing recipes that use ingredients that are familiar to many cultures. For example, one of our recipes was Chicken Adobo. This dish is a popular dish and cooking process in Philippine cuisine that involves meat, seafood, or vegetables marinated in vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic, which is browned in oil, and simmered in the marinade. In addition, we used ingredients that are cost-friendly and easy to work with to make our recipes accessible to a larger audience. Especially since we are a McMaster based initiative, students make up a large proportion of our audience. Meals that can be prepared quickly are in-demand.\nThis project was created with the assistance of various professionals in different fields. We worked with two Canadian dieticians - Shaistha Zaheeruddin and Amanda Li. Shaistha is founder of Modest Nutrition. Amanda Li is a registered dietician and chef who worked with us throughout the entire semester, constantly providing us with recipes and ideas. She is the founder of Nutrition.Wellness.Simplified where she provides recipes, consultations, and classes to the general public. She is also a professor at George Brown College where she teaches hospitality.\nThese nutritionists assisted us in creating meals that contain essential nutrients for brain health. In addition, Amanda offered to help prepare these meals. We attempted to collaborate with a neurologist throughout the entire term to help us understand how the brain functions under the influence of different diets, as well as how changes in diet can contribute to pathophysiology and/or treating brain abnormalities. However, we were unable to ascertain the assistance of a neurologist because of conflicting schedules. Peter Hoang, a McMaster student in Software Engineering helped us advertise our project to find a software engineering student that developed our MGOT App. Jenell Hogg, a software engineer at McMaster, helped us to create an App that is available on the Google Play store and App Store. We collaborated with Harman Nahal, a videographer, to assist us in documenting the MacEngaged process. For example, she videotaped our high school visit. Annaika Manamperi, a member of our group, videotaped the interview with Amanda Li that is available on YouTube and our Facebook page. Alicia Carey, a member of our group, took pictures of our Ronald McDonald House Hamilton visit and the pictures of the snacks for the App and Facebook. We released our project through our Facebook page, Hamilton Eat Local blog, YouTube, and our App. Looking forward; we are in contact with The Silhouette (McMaster Newspaper), The Hamilton Spectator, school-run journals (eg. Meducator and McMaster Undergraduate Journal of Law and Politics).\nFor more information, you can visit our Facebook page and our Youtube chanel. All our recipes can be found here\n\n\n\n",
