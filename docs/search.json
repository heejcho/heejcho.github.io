On this site, you will be able to find some of my projects I completed during my time at McMaster University.\nCurrently, I am a Personal Banking Associate at TD Canada Trust, where I provide professional financial guidance to clients on personal banking products, investments and services. Aside from banking, I am also very passionate about the field of data science. In specific, I am interested in the use of R in the context of using health data, as a decision-making tool. I enjoy using (and keep learning) tidyverse to import data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and potentially model it. I am also familiar with Python, which I learned and practiced during my undergraduate studies.\n\n\n\n",
