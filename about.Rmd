My name is __Heejeong Cho__ _(Heej: 조희정)_, and this is my personal website. On this site, you will be able to find some of my projects completed during my time at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/).

Currently, I am a Personal Banking Associate at TD Canada Trust, where I provide professional financial guidance to clients on personal banking products, investments and services. I am very passionate about data science in general, and the use of `R` in the context of the use of health data for decision-making. I enjoy using (and keep learning) `tidyverse` to import data into `R`, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and potentially model it.
