My name is __Heejeong Cho__ _(Heej)_, and this is my personal website. On this site, you will be able to find some of my projects I completed during my time at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/).

Currently, I am a Personal Banking Associate at TD Canada Trust, where I provide professional financial guidance to clients on personal banking products, investments and services. Aside from banking, I am also very passionate about the field of data science. In specific, I am interested in the use of `R` in the context of using health data, as a decision-making tool. I enjoy using (and keep learning) `tidyverse` to import data into `R`, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and potentially model it. I am also familiar with `Python`, which I learned and practiced during my undergraduate studies.
